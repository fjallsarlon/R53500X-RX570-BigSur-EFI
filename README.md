# Ryzen-BigSur-EFI

### Read

- Tested on R5 3500X, B450 S2H, RX 570, 860 Evo and works well!
- **B550 and A520 systems needs SSDT-CPUR in this EFI and their config.plist**
- **If your motherboard doesnt have a Realtek Ethernet then you need to add specific kext for your Ethernet card on your EFI/OC/Kexts and config.plist**
- **X40 systems are need to configure config.plist and probably add one more SSDT that i dont know.**
- After Install you should change your SystemUUID, SystemSerialNumber, MLB with GenSMBIOS.
- If you have sound issue after Install macOS, you should try layout ids by your sound card.
